# Overview
This project explores the potential of machine learning algorithms, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), for predicting breast cancer using the Coimbra Breast Cancer dataset. The project involves replicating results from a research paper using KNN with 4 key features and further improving the prediction accuracy by integrating PCA for dimensionality reduction.

# Dataset
The Coimbra Breast Cancer dataset consists of data from 116 women (52 with breast cancer and 64 healthy), including 10 different blood test results. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the KNN algorithm.

# The dataset consists of 10 variables:
* Age (years): the age of the individuals.
* BMI (kg/m2): Body mass index, body fat index.
* Glucose (mg/dL): Blood glucose levels.
* Insulin (µU/mL): levels of insulin, a hormone linked to glucose regulation.
* HOMA: assessment of a homeostatic model for insulin resistance and beta-cell function.
* Leptin (ng/mL): Leptin levels, a hormone involved in appetite and energy balance.
* Adiponectin (μg/ml): levels of adiponectin, a protein associated with metabolic regulation.
* Resistin (ng/mL): levels of Resistin, a protein involved in insulin resistance.
* MCP-1 (pg/dL): Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, a cytokine involved in inflammation.
